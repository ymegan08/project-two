### What Is *MoodyFriend*

 MoodyFriend is a mood tracker app that analyzes the user's moods and matches with a compatibility-based friend based on similar sentiments or opposite sentiments, a friend-finder app that helps moody friends find each other. This full-stack site will take in results from the users' surveys, then compare their answers with those from other users. The app will display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match and least overall match with the opposite mood!
